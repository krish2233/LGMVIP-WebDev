                            <p>Thailand’s capital city attracts hundreds of thousands of people from all over the globe every year. It offers tourists a unique set of characteristics – it is the largest and most developed city in Thailand but manages to
                                maintain its historical architecture and traditions dating back hundreds of years. Bangkok, which is for most a jumping off point for Thailand holidays, is packed with everything from excitement and chaos, to freedom, beauty,
                                and adventure. Through the hustle and bustle, gigantic skyscrapers, grand palaces and temples, and a world-renowned floating market, Bangkok continues to attract millions of travellers from around the world.</p>

                            <p>Singapore, city-state located at the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, about 85 miles (137 kilometres) north of the Equator. It consists of the diamond-shaped Singapore Island and some 60 small islets; the main island occupies
                                all but about 18 square miles of this combined area. The main island is separated from Peninsular Malaysia to the north by Johor Strait, a narrow channel crossed by a road and rail causeway that is more than half a mile
                                long. The southern limits of the state run through Singapore Strait, where outliers of the Riau-Lingga Archipelago—which forms a part of Indonesia—extend to within 10 miles of the main island.</p>
